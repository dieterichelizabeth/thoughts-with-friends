A Social Networking API üêªü¶äüêº

Thoughts With Friends is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends‚Äô thoughts, and create a friend list. This API includes CRUD routes for "Users" and "Thoughts", and additionally has routes for adding/deleting "reactions" to thoughts and "friends" from the friends list. Uses Express.js for routing, MongoDB (a NoSQL database), and the Mongoose Object-Document Mapper (ODM).

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

## User Story

This application was created based on the following User Story and Criteria:

```
"AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data"
```

```
"GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user‚Äôs friend list"
```

## Lessons Learned

Mongoose has built in validators for schemas. I used the ["match" validator](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html#string-validators) to validate a user's input for their email address. The following expression will check for lowecase, uppercase, and numbers before and after the @ sign, as well as after the ".".

```
"match: RegExp, creates a validator that checks if the value matches the given regular expression" -(Mongoose Documentation)

match: [/[a-zA-z0-9]+@[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]+/,
        "Invalid Email address, please try again",],
```
